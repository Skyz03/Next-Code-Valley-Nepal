# ✅ **Step-by-Step: Run, Build & Deploy (React Project Only)**

### **1. Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

---

### **2. Run the project locally**

```bash
npm run start
```

---

### **3. Build the production version**

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a **build/** folder.

---

### **4. Deploy**

Upload / copy the **build/** folder to your hosting provider (Netlify, Vercel, Firebase, S3, cPanel, Nginx/Apache server, etc.).

---

If you want, I can also write a **deploy script**, **Dockerfile**, or instructions for a specific hosting platform.
